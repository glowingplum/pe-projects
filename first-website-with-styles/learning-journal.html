<h1>Learning journal</h1>
<h2>Nostalgic beginnings</h2>
<p>Talking about the origins of GUIs, the very first experience using a PC, and watching <a href='https://youtu.be/75WFTHpOw8Y'>Bj√∂rk's TV video</a> felt truly nostalgic. Despite all the noise and marketing out there, I was able to find a school that makes sense. I was able to go back to where all begun and gather myself together for a fresh restart about web development. <em>Booong!</em></p>

<h2>Design... Design? Design!</h2>
<p><em>Web design</em> is how they name what they teach. But, do they talk about design principles, ethics, duties, the role as a <em>designer</em> for the community? Something is wrong. Hopefully, it's not too late. Not everything is lost. Let's talk about web <em>and</em> design. Welcome to Perpetual Education.</p>

<h2>Patience</h2>
<p>I'm not still where I want to be. But even a 42 km marathon begins with a single step. This is looking good :D</p>
