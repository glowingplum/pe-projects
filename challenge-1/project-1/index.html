	<h1>A hidden gem</h1>
	<p>This document contains basic information about the town of Villa Pehuenia and Argentinian food</p>

	<h2>Villa Pehuenia</h2>
	<p>This small town is located in the Patagonia region of Argentina. Its name comes from the Spanish name for the monkey puzzle tree <i>Pehuén.</i> With a population of only 1600 people, it's a relatively new village developed as a tourist destination. It still has many plots of land that need development, making it even unique for its visitors. The first observation you may make is of the trees' unusual shape guarding the entrance of the route leading to this town, which is still of gravel and might be dangerous to use when there's snow. Staying at one of the many private-owned bungalows, you can enjoy the starry night sky reflected on the Aluminé lake, wondering where exactly is the limit between the sky and the water. During the daytime, you may choose between walking around the quiet Patagonian forest guided by its birds' songs. Or you may also try kayaking the calm and crystal-clear lake or simply reading a book in front of your temporary home while waiting for the charcoal grill for your <i>parrillada</i> sipping some <i>mate</i>.</p>
